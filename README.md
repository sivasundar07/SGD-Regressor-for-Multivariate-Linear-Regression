# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required libraries and prepare the dataset with input features and target values (house price and number of occupants).
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets and apply feature scaling using StandardScaler.
3. Initialize and train the SGD Regressor models using the training data.
4. Predict house price and number of occupants for test and new inputs, evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error, and display the results. 

## Program:

# Step 1: Sample dataset
# ------------------------------
# Features: [Hours Studied, Attendance, Previous Marks]
X = np.array([
    [2, 80, 50],
    [3, 60, 40],
    [5, 90, 70],
    [7, 85, 80],
    [9, 95, 90]
], dtype=float)

# Target: Marks Scored
y = np.array([50, 45, 70, 80, 95], dtype=float)

# ------------------------------
# Step 2: Feature normalization
# ------------------------------
X_mean = X.mean(axis=0)
X_std = X.std(axis=0)
X = (X - X_mean) / X_std

# Add bias term (intercept)
X = np.c_[np.ones(X.shape[0]), X]  # shape becomes (n_samples, n_features + 1)

# ------------------------------
# Step 3: Initialize weights
# ------------------------------
n_features = X.shape[1]
weights = np.zeros(n_features)

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 1000

# Step 4: Stochastic Gradient Descent
# ------------------------------
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i in range(X.shape[0]):
        xi = X[i]
        yi = y[i]
        y_pred = np.dot(xi, weights)
        error = y_pred - yi
        # Update weights
        weights -= learning_rate * error * xi
